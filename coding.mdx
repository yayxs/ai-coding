## Background

With the development of AI programming (or AI coding), more and more products have become available, such as `Cursor` and others. To better understand the various tools, extensions, native editors, cloud editors, and terminals in this space, I have gradually compiled this content.

Currently, most `AI Coding` or `Vibe Coding` resources in the community serve as navigation sites. I initially considered creating a navigation site myself, but later felt that navigation sites alone don't provide much value. What sets this resource apart is that I want to include my own "opinionated" content.

## Current Landscape

Let's discuss the current landscape. Today, the combination of `LLM` + `MCP` + `Agent` is mainstream. We no longer focus on technical details as deeply as before, shifting gradually from depth to breadth. When developing with open-source frameworks or libraries, we don't need to obsess over specific implementation principles. I used to agonize over whether to use `Next.js` or `Astro`, but that's no longer important. We can use `GitHub MCP` and `Git MCP` to read open-source code. With the emergence of `DeepWiki` and `Context7 MCP`, as programmers, we no longer need to stress about which technology to use or even how they work under the hood.

## Native Editors

Native editors refer to applications like `VSCode` that can be installed on a user's computer.

Cursor is a product launched around the same time as ChatGPT, and it shines even brighter with the release of Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet! I have paid for it, and I believe it is currently the most powerful AI editor in the universe.
